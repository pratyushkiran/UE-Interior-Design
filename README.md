#### **4. Key Features of the Unreal Engine Archviz Project**
- **Realistic Visuals:**
   - Utilizes Unreal Engine’s high-fidelity rendering to create lifelike materials, lighting, and textures.
   
- **Interactive Elements:**
   - Clients can navigate through the space, explore different design options (materials, lighting, furniture arrangements), and make real-time changes to the design.

- **Immersive VR Experience:**
   - Offers a fully immersive experience with VR controllers, allowing users to walk through and interact with the space as if they were physically present.

- **Customization Options:**
   - Builders can offer buyers customization options (e.g., material finishes, color schemes) directly within the virtual space.

---

#### **5. Market Differentiation**
- **Visual Impact:** Unreal Engine allows for a higher level of realism compared to traditional 3D rendering tools, creating a more convincing experience.
- **Real-Time Changes:** The ability to modify design elements on the fly offers a significant advantage in client meetings.
- **Immersive Storytelling:** With VR, builders and designers can transport clients into their future spaces, providing a much more compelling pitch.
